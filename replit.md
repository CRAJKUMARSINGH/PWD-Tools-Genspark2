# PWD Tools Hub - Infrastructure Management Suite

## Overview

PWD Tools Hub is a comprehensive infrastructure management platform designed specifically for Public Works Department (PWD) operations. The application serves as a centralized hub for 10 different tools that handle various aspects of infrastructure project management, from financial processing to quality control.

The platform features a user-friendly interface with colorful, intuitive design specifically tailored for nascent clerks. It combines both internal tools (hosted within the platform) and external tools (linked applications) to provide a unified experience for PWD operations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design approach: Keep it simple and clean - no extra variables, computations, or additional information.
Target users: Nascent PWD clerks - all features must be as per approved statutory design and formats.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit-based web application with Python backend
- **Multi-page Architecture**: Modular page structure with individual tool pages under `/pages/` directory
- **Component System**: Reusable UI components in `/components/` directory for tool buttons and navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Wide layout configuration optimized for dashboard-style interface

### Application Structure
- **Main Application**: `app.py` serves as the central hub with tool grid and metrics dashboard
- **Tool Pages**: 10 individual pages (01-10) representing different PWD management tools
- **Utility Modules**: 
  - `utils/branding.py`: Custom CSS styling with green gradient theme and crane branding
  - `utils/navigation.py`: Breadcrumb navigation, back buttons, and inter-tool navigation

### Tool Integration Model
The platform uses a hybrid approach for tool integration:
- **External Tools**: Three production-ready tools hosted on external platforms (Excel se EMD, Bill & Deviation, Tender Processing)
- **Internal Tools**: Seven tools under development for future internal hosting
- **Unified Navigation**: Seamless navigation between internal and external tools with appropriate user warnings

### UI/UX Design Patterns
- **Color Scheme**: Green gradient theme (#2E8B57 to #90EE90) representing PWD branding
- **Tool Grid Layout**: 4-column responsive grid for tool access buttons
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between active external tools and tools under development
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time display of tool counts and categories

### Navigation System
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Hierarchical navigation showing current location
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Quick access to all tools from any page
- **Back Button Functionality**: Consistent return-to-home navigation
- **External Link Warnings**: User notifications when accessing external tools

## External Dependencies

### External Tool Integrations
- **Excel se EMD**: Hand Receipt Generator is now internal and self-contained (No external dependency)
- **Bill & Deviation**: Infrastructure Billing System on Streamlit Cloud (`stream-bill-generator-pjzpbb7a9fdxfmpgpg7t4d.streamlit.app`) (Requires Authentication)
- **Tender Processing**: Tender Management System on Streamlit Cloud (`priyankatenderfinal-unlhs2yudbpg2ipxgdggws.streamlit.app`) (Requires Authentication)

### Framework Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Core web application framework for rapid deployment
- **Python**: Backend runtime environment
- **Custom CSS**: Embedded styling for PWD-specific branding and user experience

### Development Tools
The platform includes functionality for seven additional tools currently under development:
- Contract Management System
- Work Order Management
- Payment Processing System
